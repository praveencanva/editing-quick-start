## Status

This library is currently alpha. We are actively iterating on this as we build out our public APIs and deliver our first set of apps built on top of it to real users.

We are aiming for a 1.0.0 stable release early 2020.

### Upcoming changes

* The client library, responsible for communicating with the Canva Editor at runtime, is currently coupled to the type definitions in this package. We will be splitting this out in the near future, and the client will be injected at runtime under `window.canva`, so that built apps do not need to include this in their bundle
